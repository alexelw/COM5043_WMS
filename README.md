## Engineering & Quality Tooling Added

* **Java 17 + Maven** – standardised build, dependency management, and project structure.
* **JUnit 5** – automated unit testing integrated into the build lifecycle.
* **JaCoCo** – test coverage reports (HTML + XML for SonarCloud).
* **Spotless (Google Java Format)** – enforced code formatting for consistency and readability.
* **Checkstyle** – lightweight coding standards (naming, structure).
* **SpotBugs** – static analysis to detect potential runtime bugs.
* **GitHub Actions CI** – runs tests, formatting, static analysis, coverage, and quality checks on every push/PR.
* **SonarCloud** – external code quality analysis (bugs, smells, coverage, maintainability).

> This tooling demonstrates professional software engineering practice, supports testing and maintainability, and provides clear evidence for the Testing & Reflection marks.
